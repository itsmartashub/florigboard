-   While all of these themes are examples based on a single color palette, the themes themselves are <b>dynamic</b>. So they are built on Material You introduced in <b>Android 12</b>, which generates a <b>dynamic palette based on the user's home wallpaper</b>.

## Important

‚ö†Ô∏è **TO MAKE THIS WORK IT IS CRUCIAL TO USE `apk` FILE ATTACHED IN [RELEASES](https://github.com/itsmartashub/florigboard/releases/)**.

-   This represents a [`debug` Florisboard version](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/actions/runs/5039154715?pr=2213) in which the [Material Design features](https://github.com/1fexd/florisboard/tree/feature/material-you-theme-colors) has been integrated by [@1fexd](https://github.com/1fexd).

-   Once [@patrickgold](https://github.com/patrickgold) officially merges [@1fexd](https://github.com/1fexd)'s Material You feature into future updates and make release with it implemented, the `apk` file from here **will be removed**.

-   I encourage you to build your own `apk` from the [source code](https://github.com/1fexd/florisboard/tree/feature/material-you-theme-colors). I merely placed that version [**here**](https://github.com/itsmartashub/florigboard/releases/) to keep things together!

## Setup

**1.** Open the **FlorisBoard Debug** app <sup>[it's important to install [this](https://github.com/itsmartashub/florigboard/releases/v2.0.0) `apk` version]</sup> <br/>
**2.** Click on `Theme` ‚û°Ô∏è `Manage installed themes` <br/>
**3.** Click on `Import` ‚û°Ô∏è `Select files` <br/>
**4.** Select the `flex` file you have downloaded <sup>`gboardish.flex`</sup> <br/>
**5.** You should see `10` new themes. <br/>
**6.** Go back to `Theme`, and then press `Selected theme` to select the theme you prefer for `‚òÄÔ∏è Day theme ` and `üåô Night theme `

## Themes <sup>(10)</sup>

-   üåí **DARKER** (Border/Borderless)
-   üåë **AMOLED** (Border/Borderless)

## Warnings

-   As a Material You themes creator, my involvement is limited to the creation of themes <sup>[`gboardish.flex` file]</sup>. I do not engage in alterations to the [source code](https://github.com/1fexd/florisboard/tree/feature/material-you-theme-colors) nor initiate FlorisBoard `commits`.
-   The provided `florisboard-0.4.0-debug-MYD.apk` file represents a `DEBUG` version of [Florisboard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard). Please anticipate the presence of bugs and anomalies in its functionality.
-   The themes have been tested on **Android 12** and **13**.
