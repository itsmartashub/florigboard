<p>While all of these themes are examples based on a single color palette, the themes themselves are <b>dynamic</b>. So they are built on Material You introduced in <b>Android 12</b>, which generates a <b>dynamic palette based on the user's home wallpaper.</b></p>

## Important

‚ö†Ô∏è **TO MAKE THIS WORK IT IS CRUCIAL TO USE `apk` FILE ATTACHED IN [RELEASES](https://github.com/itsmartashub/floristyle/releases/)**.

-   It represents a `DEBUG` [Florisboard version](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/actions/runs/5039154715?pr=2213) in which the Material Design features has been integrated by [@1fexd](https://github.com/1fexd). Please anticipate the presence of bugs and anomalies in its functionality.

-   Once [@patrickgold](https://github.com/patrickgold) officially merges [@1fexd](https://github.com/1fexd)'s Material You feature into future updates and make release with it implemented, the `apk` file from here **will be removed**.

-   I encourage you to build your own `apk` from the [source code](https://github.com/1fexd/florisboard/tree/feature/material-you-theme-colors). I temporarily placed that version [**here**](https://github.com/itsmartashub/floristyle/releases/) merely to keep things together!

## Setup

**1.** &nbsp; Open the **FlorisBoard Debug** app <sup>[it's important to install [this](https://github.com/itsmartashub/floristyle/releases/v2.0.0) `apk` version]</sup> <br/>
**2.** &nbsp; Click on `Theme` ‚û°Ô∏è `Manage installed themes` <br/>
**3.** &nbsp; Click on `Import` ‚û°Ô∏è `Select files` <br/>
**4.** &nbsp; Select the `flex` file you have downloaded <sup>`gboardish.flex`</sup> <br/>
**5.** &nbsp; You should see `10` new themes. <br/>
**6.** &nbsp; Go back to `Theme`, and then press `Selected theme` to select the theme you prefer for `‚òÄÔ∏è Day theme ` and `üåô Night theme `

## Themes <sup>(10)</sup>

-   ‚òÄÔ∏è **LIGHT** (Border/Borderless)
-   üåì **DARK** (Border/Borderless)
-   üåí **DARKER** (Border/Borderless)
-   üåë **AMOLED** (Border/Borderless)

## Warnings

-   As a Material You themes creator, my involvement is limited to the creation of themes <sup>`gboardish.flex`</sup>. I do not engage in alterations to the source code nor initiate Florisboard `commits`.
-   The themes have been tested on **Android 12** and **13**.

‚ö†Ô∏è The `apk` version in the releases is **always the same**. The `flex` file is the one that has been updated! If you have already downloaded this special <sup>`debug`</sup> version of the app or built it yourself, there's no need to download it again!
