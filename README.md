-   While all of these themes are examples based on a single color palette, the themes themselves are <b>dynamic</b>. So they are built on Material You introduced in <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_12">Android 12</a></b>, which generates a <b>dynamic palette based on the user's home wallpaper</b>.

## ❗ Important

-   To make this work it is important to use [~~this~~ [**expired**]](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/actions/runs/5039154715/job/13643367775?pr=2213)<sup><code>debug</code></sup> FlorisBoard version in which the [Material Design features](https://github.com/1fexd/florisboard/tree/feature/material-you-theme-colors) has been integrated by <img src="https://github.com/itsmartashub/florigboard/assets/123305689/39821df6-c679-4339-b21e-166095cc16c5" width="25"> <a href="https://github.com/1fexd">1fexd </a>

-   I encourage you to get the `.apk` by building on your own from the [source code](https://github.com/1fexd/florisboard/tree/feature/material-you-theme-colors). But i have also placed the `.apk` file of that version [**here**](https://github.com/itsmartashub/florigboard/releases) (`florisboard-0.4.0-debug-MYD.apk`) to keep things together!
-   Once Patrick officially merges [1fexd](https://github.com/1fexd)'s Material You feature into future updates and make release with it implemented, the APK file from here will be removed.

## ⚠️ Warning (disclaimers)

- As a 🎨**MDY Themes Creator**🎨, my involvement is limited to the creation of themes (`gboardish.flex` file). I do not engage in alterations to the [source code](https://github.com/1fexd/florisboard/tree/feature/material-you-theme-colors) nor initiate FlorisBoard `commits`.
- The provided `florisboard-0.4.0-debug-MYD.apk` file represents a 🐞`debug`🐞 version of [FlorisBoard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard). Please anticipate the presence of bugs and anomalies in its functionality.
- The themes have been tested on **Android 12 and 13**. Material You **is not supported** on any OS version lower than Android 12. However, I could create a few **static** themes that resemble Gboard.

## 🎨 Themes <sup><b><code>10</code><b></sup>

-   ☀️ **LIGHT** (Border/Borderless)
-   🌒 **DARK** (Border/Borderless)
-   🌑 **AMOLED** (Border/Borderless)

## ⚙️ Setup

-   Open the **FlorisBoard Debug** app (it's important to install this `.apk` version)
-   Click on `Theme` ➡️ `Manage installed themes`
-   Click on `Import` ➡️ `Select files`
-   Select the `flex` file you have downloaded (`gboardish.flex`)
-   You should see **10** new themes.
-   Go back to `Theme`, and then press `Selected theme` to select the theme you prefer for `☀️ Day theme ` and `🌙 Night theme `
